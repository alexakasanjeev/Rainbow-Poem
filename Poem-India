No rainbows in the sky
No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
it will make all go in vain

I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I can't stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
and do epic stuff!
I am an indian by heart
I enjoy the ride of coding train :)
And coder by soul!
I love not only git but also github,
Lets go to the pub!
Yohooo!!
:) :D :< :O :| :\ :C :B 
I love coding

India is my country
It is really a beautiful place 

I learn something about gihub
